# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current Transaction schema in the wallet module has a type determination error with the `withdrawalDetails` field. Mongoose cannot determine the proper type for this field because it uses a TypeScript union/intersection type without explicit type decoration. This is causing runtime errors when the application starts, preventing the system from functioning properly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Transaction schema to properly define all field types, so that the application can start without type determination errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the Transaction schema SHALL load without throwing CannotDetermineTypeError
2. WHEN defining complex object types in Mongoose schemas THEN the system SHALL use explicit type definitions with @Prop decorators
3. WHEN the withdrawalDetails field is accessed THEN it SHALL maintain proper TypeScript type safety

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want withdrawal details to be properly structured and validated, so that payment processing can work reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a withdrawal transaction is created THEN the system SHALL validate withdrawal details based on the withdrawal method
2. WHEN bank transfer is selected THEN the system SHALL require bankName, accountNumber, and accountName fields
3. WHEN mobile money is selected THEN the system SHALL require mobileNumber and operatorName fields
4. WHEN withdrawal details are stored THEN they SHALL maintain referential integrity and proper data types

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the schema to be maintainable and extensible, so that future payment methods can be easily added.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new withdrawal methods are added THEN the schema SHALL support extending withdrawal details without breaking existing functionality
2. WHEN schema changes are made THEN they SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing transaction records
3. WHEN the schema is modified THEN it SHALL include proper validation rules for data integrity
